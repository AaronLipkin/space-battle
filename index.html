	<h1>Instructions:</h1>
	<p>Welcome to your first space battle.  You are the captain of the USS Starkiller. Your command post is currently hidden over to the right, you can press <em class="shortcut"> "command - option - J". </em> You have two warp corridors you could go down.  Warp corridor one will take you into <em class="enemy">Klingon</em> territory.  Klingon ships are powerful, but unrefined.  They have strong shields and stronger weapons but their targeting systems are ancient.  Down the other corridor is <em class="enemy">Romulan</em> space.  Romulan ships are relatively fragile and their lasers won't exactly rip through your hull, but they are millimeter precise on their aiming.  Lucky for you, the USS Starkiller is a beast, with guns on par with the Klingon's and targeting systems that even a Romulan would envy. Your task is to blast your way through 8 enemy ships without getting blown up yourself.  To help you on your way, about a third of enemies will leave behind materials you can use to repair some damage to your hull.  Good luck, and don't die!</p>
